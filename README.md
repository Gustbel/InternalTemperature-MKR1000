# InternalTemperature - MKR1000

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/ElectronicCats/ElectronicCats_InternalTemperatureZero . The problem with the repository named above is that it is not prepared to correctly display the **Internal Temperature of the Arduino MKR1000** development board, but after making some small adjustments to the code, the Internal Temperature of this development board can be read correctly, this repository does this. 

Please ignore the *Arduino Zero* name, this repository is for *Arduino MKR1000*.
